Logic: 
1. if array is empty return empty string
2. sort to get shortest length string 1st so that we only have to loop through chars of this string which is max possible prefix length
3. get character by character of this string and check with the respective position character of the remaining strings in the list
4. if any mismatch return immediatly and give the string upto that point as output
5. if we ar eable to complete the loop , means that whole string is present as prefix in all strings, s owe return that whole string
