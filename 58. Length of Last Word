# Qquestion

Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

# Solution:

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        i = len(s) - 1
        length = 0

        while i >= 0 and s[i] == ' ' :
            i -= 1

        while i >= 0 and s[i] != ' ' :
            length += 1
            i -= 1
        
        return length

# Logic:

- We have to check last word, so we have to go from last to first
- we have to skip any initial spaces
- once we find the 1st char, we have to keep going a finding length until next space is hit
- we immediatly return the length
