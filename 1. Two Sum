Solution Current - Logic :
instead of checking each combination of items, we check if difference from the target is a number we have seen till that point, 

    if yes we return the array of index of that item and current item, 
    
    if not we store that numer as key and its index as value in the dictionary , so that it can be looked up in later loops

    Operation	            Cost
    Loop through list	    O(n)
    Dictionary lookup	    O(1)
    Total	                O(n)

Solution 1: O(n^2) complexity:

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        for i, v1 in enumerate(nums):
            for j, v2 in enumerate(nums[i+1:], start=i+1):
                if v1 + v2 == target:
                    return [i, j]


Solution 1 - Loop running logic: 

[2 , 4, 7, 8, 5]
i = 0 , v1 = 2
    num = num[1:0] => [4, 7, 8, 5] 
    j = 1 , v2 = 4
    j = 2 , v2 = 7
    j = 3 , v2 = 8
    j = 4 , v2 = 5

i = 1 , v1 = 4
    num = num[2:0] => [7, 8, 5] 
    j = 2 , v2 = 7
    j = 3 , v2 = 8
    j = 4 , v2 = 5
    
..................... till i = 5

Complexity : O(n^2)
