## Question

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.
 

Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?


## Solution

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        seen = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            diff = target - num

            if diff in seen :
                return[seen[diff] , i ]
            seen[num] = i

Solution Current - Logic :
instead of checking each combination of items, we check if difference from the target is a number we have seen till that point, 

    if yes we return the array of index of that item and current item, 
    
    if not we store that numer as key and its index as value in the dictionary , so that it can be looked up in later loops

    Operation	            Cost
    Loop through list	    O(n)
    Dictionary lookup	    O(1)
    Total	                O(n)

Solution 1: O(n^2) complexity:

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        for i, v1 in enumerate(nums):
            for j, v2 in enumerate(nums[i+1:], start=i+1):
                if v1 + v2 == target:
                    return [i, j]


Solution 1 - Loop running logic: 

[2 , 4, 7, 8, 5]
i = 0 , v1 = 2
    num = num[1:0] => [4, 7, 8, 5] 
    j = 1 , v2 = 4
    j = 2 , v2 = 7
    j = 3 , v2 = 8
    j = 4 , v2 = 5

i = 1 , v1 = 4
    num = num[2:0] => [7, 8, 5] 
    j = 2 , v2 = 7
    j = 3 , v2 = 8
    j = 4 , v2 = 5
    
..................... till i = 5

Complexity : O(n^2)
