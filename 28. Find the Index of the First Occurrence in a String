# Question:

Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.
 
Example 1:

Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
Example 2:

Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.

# Solution:

class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        
        if not needle:
            return 0

        if len(haystack) < len(needle):
            return -1

        for i in range( len(haystack) - len(needle) + 1):
            if haystack[i : i + len(needle)] == needle:
                return i
        
        return -1

# Logic:

- We have to find the position at which we can find the complete "needle" string in next index positions
- Now we clearly do not need to check character by character, we just need to slice of the strings equal to the length of "needle" string, and match it
- we also need to check these strings until there is a string equal to the length of "needle" string possible, that means we don't need to check last few combination where we cannot form string of len = len"needle"
- we go and create sub-strings in each loop moving forward, and return the 1st index position where match happens.
- we return - 1 in other cases
- exceptions : empty needle string OR if length of needle string > len haystack string


# Shortcut:

haystack.find(needle)   ==> this will return 1st matching index or -1 if no match occurs
