## Question:

Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.

## Solution:

class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        write = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)) :
            if nums[i] != val :
                nums[write] = nums[i]
                write += 1
        return write

## Logic:

- If we have an item in the array which is not equal to the value given, we have to do nothing and move forward
- If we have an item in the array which is equal to the value given, we have to replace it with a item that is not equal to the value
- so basically the core logic will be to treat each item in the array as just positions to write, we only write into the position if read pointer (i) gives us a item != value
- the write moves forward only in such conditions, in all other condition the read (i) keeps moving forward to find the next item that is != value, when it finds it:
- that item is written at the postion where write was at last, then both read and write moves forward.
