# MyLeetCode_Solutions

A personal collection of my LeetCode solutions with detailed explanations of the logic and approach used to solve each problem.

## Goal

To create a reference database where I can:
- Revisit problems I've previously solved
- Understand the reasoning behind each solution
- Document my thought process and approach
- Build a knowledge base that grows with my problem-solving skills

This repository serves as my personal study guide—if I forget a concept or approach, I'll have my thinking steps documented right alongside the code.

## Current Approach

I'm currently using AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude & Gemini) to help me understand complex concepts and build problem-solving logic. As I progress, my goal is to develop the skills to solve problems independently.

## Structure

Each solution file is named according to its LeetCode problem number for easy reference.

**Find the problems here:** [LeetCode Problem Set](https://leetcode.com/problemset/)

## Why This Repo?

Learning to code isn't just about solving problems—it's about understanding *why* a solution works. This repository is my journey of building that understanding, one problem at a time.
