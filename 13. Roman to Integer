## Question

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
Example 3:

Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 15
s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].

## Solution

class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        values = {
            'I': 1, 'V': 5, 'X': 10, 'L': 50, 'C': 100, 'D': 500, 'M': 1000
        }
        total = 0
        n = len(s)
        for i in range(n) :
            curnt = values[s[i]]
            if i + 1 < n and curnt < values[s[i+1]] :
                total -= curnt
            else : 
                total += curnt
        return total

Core Logic: for every letter in the string, if the letters values is greater than the next letter's value we add its actual value , if its less than the next letter's value we subtract it (example XL - X : 10 , L : 50 , 10 < 50 , so we do a -10, then L is last string, its value is 50 so we add 50 thus we get 40)

Edge cases:
1. Letter's value is less than the next letter's value
2. Last letter will not have a next letter to compare it to, should be handled and added by default
