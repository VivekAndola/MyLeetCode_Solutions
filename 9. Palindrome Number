## Question

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 

Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1
 

Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

## Solution

class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        if x < 0 or (x != 0 and x % 10 == 0) :
            return False
        rev_x = 0
        while x > rev_x :
            rev_x = rev_x * 10 + x % 10
            x //= 10
        return x == rev_x or x == rev_x // 10 

'''
Logic : 
- we have to take 1 digit at a time from the end of x and add it to rev_x, in such a way that in each loop we treat the previously avaiable value in re_x to be 1 place higher. Thus our goal of reversing will work
- if 121 is number, we peel of 1 from the end , assign it to rev_x in 1st loop and then remove the digit from x, 
- then in the next loop we ove hte already present 1 in rev_x to 10s position so that our new number peeled i.e. 2 is added at 1s place, 
- if 10 is not multiplied then we will keep on adding numbers at 1s place, failing to create the reverse number.

Example : 

x = 1331

loop 1 : 
start -> x = 1331 rev_x = 0

rev_x = rev_x * 10 + x % 10
x //= 10

end -> x = 133 rev_x = 1

loop 2 : 
start -> x = 133 rev_x = 1

rev_x = rev_x * 10 + x % 10
x //= 10

end - x = 13 rev_x = 10 + 3 i.e. 13
