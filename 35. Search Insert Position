# Question:

Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4


# Solution:

class Solution:
    def searchInsert(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if target <= nums[i]:
                return i

        return len(nums)

# Logic

- We have to find the position of the item either matching or is > target, since we would want :
- either the position of exact matching element
- OR the first item which is just greater than the target, we would place the target in the position of that element as per ordered list.

# Exception / Edge cases

- edge case handled when target is > than all elements, our loop will end and return null, thus we have to add handling for such cases, 
- the output should the the last position which is the length of the array / list
